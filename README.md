Wine Classification Model

Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which provides insight into how well the model distinguishes between the different wine classes.

Conclusion
The confusion matrix shows a strong diagonal pattern, indicating that the model correctly classifies most samples.
This diagonal dominance is a positive sign, reflecting good overall performance.
However, there are misclassifications, particularly in class_1, where some samples were incorrectly predicted as other classes.

Key Points
Strong diagonal → good classification accuracy.
Misclassifications in class_1 → room for improvement.
